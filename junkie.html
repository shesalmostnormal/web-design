  		<h1>Junkie</h1>
      <p>Adrenal glands keep convulsing</p>
      <p>And hands became damp, shaking</p>
      <p>As epinephrine starts to swell</p>
      <p>Vasoconstricting; stop and breathe.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>The rush builds 'til all is surreal</p>
      <p>Like drugs, trust me. It's worth the thrill.</p>
      <p>As an amateur, I still fear</p>
      <p>The consequences, but I've got skill.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>No one will know, unless I'm caught.</p>
      <p>Nobody would suspect, but if I fuck</p>
      <p>It up--no second thoughts; a five-</p>
      <p>Finger discount saves a few bucks.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>And my heart speeds at the rate of</p>
      <p>Engines. "Hey you!" Someone calls out.</p>
      <p>Then the shock channels through my brain</p>
      <p>While the blood blitz to my neck's veins.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>My pace hastens along with my</p>
      <p>Pulse. A hand clutches my shoulder--</p>
      <p>I spin around. "You dropped this," says</p>
      <p>A mall cop, handing me a ten.</p>
